# Exam Taker
A simple application written in pure Java (Swing) for taking exams

I developed this ability many years ago and used to myself to prepare for exams. I ran across it recently and decided
to release it on GitHub.

## Building the application

mvn clean package

## Run the sample exam

java -jar ./target/exams-0.10-jar-with-dependencies.jar ./src/test/resources/practice-exam.xml
